## Help Documentation
### System and Hardware Requirements

There are no hardware requirements, however the device must have a terminal to run the application.

The application can run on any of the following operating systems:
- MacOS
- Windows
- Linux

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.12 or higher
- Git

### Dependencies
The application requires the external package - colored 2.2.4 to run. This can be installed in the Python virtual environment.

### Steps to Install
1. Open WSL terminal
2. Click on code on the GitHub repository and clone via SSH or HTTPS  
![GitHub - code](docs/GitHub_code.png)  
via SSH
```
git clone git@github.com:theresanx/Theresa-T1A3_TerminalApp.git
```
via HTTPS
```
git clone https://github.com/theresanx/Theresa-T1A3_TerminalApp.git
```
3. Navigate into the ```src``` directory by using ```cd PATH/src```
where "PATH" is the file path where the src folder is located on your device
4. When running the application for the first time, execute check.sh script to check if the necessary python verison is installed.
Run the below commands in the terminal:
```
chmod +x check.sh
```
```
./check.sh
```
Please ignore step 5 if step 4 is executed
5. Or run the below commands in the terminal to start application:
```
chmod +x run.sh
```
```
./run.sh
```

## App Features
### Main Menu
- Displays all options the user can choose from
- If the user input is not a listed option, it prompts for a retry and error message appears

![Main menu](/docs/Main-menu.png)  
![Main menu error](docs/Main-menu_error.png)

- ```while``` loop, nested with an ```if elif else``` statement continually prompts the ```create_menu``` function until the user selects option 5 to exit

def create_menu():
    print(f"{colored.Fore.deep_sky_blue_4c}Enter 1 to add an expense to the list.")
    print("Enter 2 to remove an expense on the list.")
    print("Enter 3 to view all expenses on the list.")
    print("Enter 4 to search from a $ range on the list.")
    print(f"Enter 5 to exit.{colored.Style.reset}")

    user_choice = input(
        colored.stylize("Please enter your selection: ", styling.input)
    )
    return user_choice

choice = ""

while choice != "5":
    choice = create_menu()

    if choice == "1":
        functions.add_line_break()
        functions.add_expense(file_name)

        ))
        functions.add_line_break()
```

### Feature 1: Add Expense
- User inputs date, description and amount of a new expense
- If user input is valid, it displays a message to confirm expense has been added. Data is valid when date follows DD/MM/YYYY format and the amount is a positive float
- If user input is invalid, it prompts for a retry and error message appears
- Prompts if user would like to add another expense
- If user input is invalid for add another expense, it returns to the main menu

![Feature 1 - Successful](docs/Feature1-success.png)  
![Feature 1 - Invalid Date](docs/Feature1_invalid-date.png) 
![Feature 1 - Invalid Amount](docs/Feature1_invalid-amount.png)  
![Feature 1 - Negative](docs/Feature1_negative-amount.png)  
![Feature 1 - Add Another Expense, Invalid Response](docs/Feature1_add-another-invalid.png)

- ```add_expense``` and ```add_another_expense``` are separate functions to keep the them small (following Google Python style guide)
- CSV file is opened in ```append``` mode to add the new expense into an existing file
- Error handling uses ```try except``` block, as well as ```if``` statement to raise an exception for negative numbers and display the relevant error messages

### Feature 2: Remove Expense
- Displays all expenses in list before user inputs line number of an existing expense to be removed
- If user input is valid, it displays a message. Data is valid when the line number is an integer
- If user input is invalid, it prompts for a retry and error message appears

![Feature 2 - Remove Another Expense, Invalid Response](docs/Feature2_remove-another-invalid.png)

- ```remove_expense``` and ```remove_another_expense``` are separate functions to keep the them small (following Google Python style guide)
- CSV file is opened in ```reader``` mode locate expense line to be removed and then in ```writer``` mode to overwrite existing file
- Line number (which is the index number) is found using ```enumerate``` function
- Error handling uses ```try except``` blocks and displays the relevant error message

### Feature 3: View All Expenses

- Data displayed includes line number, date, description and amount of the expense
- Displays a message if no expenses to display

![Feature 3](docs/Feature3.png)  
![Feature 3 - No Expenses](docs/Feature3_no-expense.png)

- If user input is valid, it displays all expenses within the range. Data is valid when min and max amount is a positive float and max amount is greater than min amount
- Displays a message if no expenses are within range
- If user input is invalid, it prompts for a retry and error message appears 
- Prompts if user would like to search another range
- If user input is invalid for search another expense, it returns to the main menu

### Feature 5: Exit 
- Displays farewell message
- Exits application

![Farewell message](/docs/Feature5.png)

## Implementation Plan
For my implementation plan, I started by created a Trello board to create a checklist of what to do in the planning stage. In this, I decided to create a flowchart diagram before adding more cards on the board.

The below flowchart was created and helped me visualise the break down how each feature would work. With this, I could easily create a checklist on the steps needed to build each feature for each card on the Trello board. There were minor changes from the flowchart, for example, creating an error for Option 1 and 4 if the user inputs a negative number as it was not thought of until code execution. However, I had stuck to the flowchart for the most part.

![Expense Tracker Flowchart](docs/Expense-tracker_flowchart.png)  
![Trello - Planning Stage](docs/Trello_planning.png)

Each feature had its own card with a checklist of what needed to be completed with a deadline. Each feature was prioritised by how easily it could be completed.

![Trello - Feature 3](docs/Trello_feature3.png)  
![Trello - Feature 1](docs/Trello_feature1.png)  
![Trello - Feature 2](docs/Trello_feature2.png)  
![Trello - Feature 4](docs/Trello_feature4.png)  

Other cards included Import Packages, GitHub to ensure I was actively committing and pushing my work on my repository and the Help Documentation to ensure all requirements were covered. These had a longer deadline as these would be completed closer to the end of the project.

![Trello - Packages](docs/Trello_packages.png)  
![Trello - GitHub](docs/Trello_github.png)  
![Trello - Help](docs/Trello_help.png)  

## Packages
My application uses the below packages:
- **os.path** allows us to check if csv file exists
- **csv** allows us to read or write in existing csv file
- **datetime** allows us to manipulate the date
- **colored** allows us to use colour and formatting in the terminal
- **venv** allows us to create virtual environment

## Code Style Guide
My application adheres to the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

Some of the styling guides that I have implemented in my code includes:
- Use import statements for packages and modules only, not for individual types, classes, or functions
- Import each module using the full pathname location of the module
- Imports should be on separate lines 
- Exceptions - Never use catch-all except: statements, or catch Exception or StandardError
- True/False Evaluations - Use the “implicit” false if at all possible
- Lexical scoping
- Maximum line length is 80 characters
- Use parentheses sparingly
- Whitespace standard rules
- Use a f-string when appropriate
